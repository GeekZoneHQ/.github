## Migration from 'master'

Our industry is moving toward [more inclusive terminology](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/), so Geek.Zone has taken the decision to do likewise. As of 2022-04-30T17:00, Geek.Zone will begin to retire all instances of the term 'master' from our codebase, replacing it with 'main'. Please ensure that you have updated your local repo accordingly.
